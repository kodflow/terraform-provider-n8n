# N8N Terraform Provider - Enterprise Edition Examples

These examples will require n8n Enterprise Edition license for access to advanced features.

## 🚧 Coming Soon

Enterprise edition examples are currently in development and will be added once enterprise license access is available for testing.

## Planned Resources

### Projects

- Organize workflows and credentials into projects
- Manage project-level permissions
- Assign users to projects with roles

### Users

- Manage user accounts and access
- Configure user roles and permissions
- User lifecycle management

### Source Control

- Git integration for workflow versioning
- Pull workflows from Git repositories
- Synchronize multiple instances

## Directory Structure

```
enterprise/
├── projects/        # (Coming soon)
├── users/           # (Coming soon)
└── source-control/  # (Coming soon)
```

## Why Not Available Yet?

Enterprise features require:

- n8n Enterprise Edition instance
- Valid enterprise license
- Testing environment with enterprise features enabled

These examples will be similar to the community examples but with additional enterprise-specific resources and features.

## In the Meantime

Check out the [community examples](../community/) which work with:

- n8n Community Edition (free, self-hosted)
- n8n Cloud (free tier and paid plans)

All community features are fully functional and tested.
