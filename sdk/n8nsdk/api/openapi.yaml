              * For personal projects: Only workflows created by the same user
              * For team projects: Only workflows within the same team project
            - `workflowsFromAList`: Only specific workflows listed in the `callerIds` field can call this workflow

            Controls whether this workflow is accessible via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

            When enabled, this workflow can be called by MCP clients (AI assistants and other tools
            that support MCP). This allows external AI tools to discover and execute this workflow
            as part of their capabilities.

            Requirements for enabling MCP access:
            - The workflow must be active (not deactivated)
            - The workflow must contain at least one active Webhook node
            - Only webhook-triggered workflows can be exposed via MCP

            Security note: When a workflow is available in MCP, it can be discovered and executed
            by any MCP client that has the appropriate API credentials for your n8n instance.

            Controls whether this workflow is accessible via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

            When enabled, this workflow can be called by MCP clients (AI assistants and other tools
            that support MCP). This allows external AI tools to discover and execute this workflow
            as part of their capabilities.

            Requirements for enabling MCP access:
            - The workflow must be active (not deactivated)
            - The workflow must contain at least one active Webhook node
            - Only webhook-triggered workflows can be exposed via MCP

            Security note: When a workflow is available in MCP, it can be discovered and executed
            by any MCP client that has the appropriate API credentials for your n8n instance.
